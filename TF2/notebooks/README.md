# Introduction

These notebooks are created following the TFT scripts in the TF2 folder. The data created by [Data preparation.ipynb](/v0/notebooks/Data%20preparation.ipynb) is later used by the [Train.ipynb](/v0/notebooks/Train.ipynb) notebook to train the TFT model.

For now these merged datasets are uploaded in the shared google drive. You can generate your own data by running the preparation notebook. Or download them from the following links:
