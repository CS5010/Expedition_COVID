    "This notebook normalizes the industry groups. In the preprocessed industry occupation csv files in folder [Industry](../../dataset_additional/Industry/), the individual group distribution has again been min max scaled before dumping them in csv files. Which makes sum of all these groups > 1 for a single county. This may create confusion as sum of these percentage should be 1.00 for a county. Hence this notebook takes care of that and dumps the combined file [Industry Groups.csv](../../dataset_raw/CovidMay17-2022/Industry%20Groups.csv)."
