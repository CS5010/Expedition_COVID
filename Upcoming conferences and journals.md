Collected from [Research.com](https://research.com/conference-rankings/computer-science/2021), https://deadlines.info/, [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=computer%20science), [Resurchify](https://www.resurchify.com/), [LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=50&q=covid-19+forecasting&hl=en&as_sdt=0,47). I found most covid papers are published in journals.
